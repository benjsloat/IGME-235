# Project 2 Documentation

### SOURCES:
-amiibo logo from Nintendo
-api from amiiboapi.com

### PROCESS:
We started with the amiibo API starter file. We changed what we request from the actual API; by default, the user would have to essentially have the exact url of the character. We changed it to filter the entire list of amiibo instead, which gave better search functionality. After that, we added additional filter options and improved the CSS.

### SPECIAL:
This site has a greatly improved search function. I'm going to give you some examples of things that wouldn't have worked in the original API, that do in our website:
-"Cloud" Cloud Strife must be used.
-"King K Rool" You must use King K. Rool
-"King" Would have returned nothing, now returns King K Rool and two King Dededes.
-"Mr. Game & Watch" For whatever reason, it was "G&W".
We're very proud of the better search functionality.

### SELF GRADE:
