## Keyboard Racer Overview

### Overview
Keyboard Racer is a two-player racing game where each player tries 
to reach the finish before the other. However, they'll find obstacles 
in their way that require attention to be diverted from driving, which 
adds an extra element of competition and stress in this high-stakes environment.

Players will "drive" their car as fast as they can along a straight road by
rapidly pressing two buttons on their side of the keyboard. However, random
"roadblocks" will appear periodically throughout the race. Roadblocks consist
of five or so letters that a player needs to type as fast as possible (as 
they're unable to drive while a roadblock is active) before continuing.

### High Concept
Two players race each other to the finish while attempting to clear 
"roadblocks" as quickly as possible.

### Genre
It's a two-player competitive racing game.

### Story
The game has no established story. However, the "action" all comes 
from the competitivity of the two players. Presumably, the action of 
two players pressing buttons as quickly as possible will garner some 
stress from each player as they listen to the sounds of the other 
player's buttons being mashed. Plus the fact that the players will be 
right next to each other while racing adds to the competitivity. There's 
no story, but each player has a clearly established goal - to beat the other player.

### Aesthetics
The game will be relatively simple in terms of looks, most likely being a little 
more detailed than the example images in this page and the Overview page.

There will be a few sound effects (an announcer counting down the start of the 
race, tires screeching when a car starts, etc) as well as a short, tense tune 
playing for the duration of the race.

### Gameplay
#### Mechanics
Each player will take control of a car and attempt to move it forward as fast 
as possible, in order to reach a finish line that is a set distance away. As 
the car moves forward, a visual indicator on the screen slowly fills up, so 
each player can view their approximate distance through the course (as well 
as the other player's) at any time. Randomly throughout the race, players 
will encounter "roadblocks" which appear on the road ahead of their car as 
jumbles of letters (the positions of the roadblocks along the road are 
randomly generated, but they're the same for each player). The players will 
be unable to move their car while a roadblock is visible ahead of them, so 
in order to "clear" the roadblock, the letters must be typed in order. After
the roadblock is cleared, the player will be free to start their car up 
again and continue along the path towards the finish.

#### Controls
To properly play the game, the two players should sit on opposite sides of 
the keyboard so that Player 1 can acess the left side, and Player 2 can 
access the right. When the race begins, to move their cars forward, Player 1 
will repeatedly tap the 'z' and 'x' keys as fast as possible, and Player 2 
will tap the '.' and '/' keys. Each key must be pressed before a player's 
car will be moved by the first - that is, a player must press each button 
in succession. Player 1, for example, won't move their car anywhere by 
mashing 'z' only. When a roadblock is encountered, the letters that appear 
for each player will consist only of letters from each player's respective 
side of the keyboard (as exemplified in the gameplay image below). Pressing 
any of the "drive" buttons will not move the car forward until that player's roadblock is cleared.

#### Tutorial
There will be a tutorial screen showing the controls for each player accessible from the title screen.

### Process
Before even starting to work on the first page/CSS, I decided to start making 
the images I knew I'd have to put in. Using Photoshop I put together the mockups 
of the title screen and gameplay. The cars aren't mine (if you couldn't tell 
from the sudden amount of detail in them), I grabbed a "red car" pixel art image
from a free image site (in sources below) and changed its colors to make the blue version.

After I made the images I needed, I made a relatively simple overview page for 
index.html and made the CSS rules I'd be using for the whole site alongside that
page. From there, using the overview page as a base for the other pages, I included
the information I needed (going off the project proposal example for my proposal 
page) to wrap up the first part of the project.
